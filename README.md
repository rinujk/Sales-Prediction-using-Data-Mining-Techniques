# Sales-Prediction-using-Data-Mining-Techniques
Predicting sales by analysing the customer's purchase history helps the business develop intelligent data-driven decisions which enhance business growth. Combining current and historical data to make reliable predictions for future trends and forecasts has become necessary for any business. Retailers can introduce and create more efficient marketing strategies for particular consumer segments if they have a thorough understanding of their consumers' characteristics, habits, and motivations from previous shopping seasons. This project creates a roadmap for analysing customers' shopping behaviour and sales prediction to apply different machine learning algorithms to the Black Friday dataset.
